## Unsupervised Learning Techniques to identify Biological Agents for Mass Spectrometry

### This repository explores the application of unsupervised learning techniques to identify and classify biological agents from mass spectrometry data. Our dataset consists of mass spectra for two proteins (Protein A and B) and two bacterial agents (Bacteria C and D). 

### Below is an illustration of the mass spectra for the four agents.

### The figure comprises:

- **Top Panel**: Heatmaps displaying the intensity patterns of the mass spectra for each biological agent.
- **Number of Spectral Bands**: Corresponding spectral plots highlighting key intensity peaks and variations. These patterns serve as distinct features for differentiation.
